      Introduction
      Monad is a high-performance Ethereum-compatible L1. Monad materially advances the efficient frontier in the tradeoff between decentralization and scalability.
      Monad introduces optimizations in four major areas, resulting in a blockchain with throughput of 10,000 transactions per second (tps):
      
      Monad's improvements address existing bottlenecks while preserving seamless compatibility for application developers (full EVM bytecode compatibility) and users (Ethereum RPC API compatibility). As a result, the rich landscape of Ethereum tooling and applied cryptography research can plug seamlessly into Monad while benefiting from improved throughput and scale:
      applications (any dapp built for Ethereum)
      developer tooling (e.g. Hardhat, Apeworx, Foundry)
      wallets (e.g. MetaMask)
      analytics/indexing (e.g. Etherscan, Dune)
      
      The Monad client is built with a focus on performance and is written from scratch in C++ and Rust. The subsequent pages survey the major changes in Monad as well as the interface for users.
     
      Briefings
      Here are several versions of the same briefing, depending on the user's knowledge of / interest in blockchain systems:
      
      Monad for users
      Monad is a high-performance Ethereum-compatible L1, offering users the best of both worlds: portability and performance.
      From a portability perspective, Monad offers full bytecode compatibility for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), so that applications built for Ethereum can be ported to Monad without code changes, and full Ethereum RPC compatibility, so that infrastructure like MetaMask or Etherscan  can be used seamlessly.
      From a performance perspective, Monad offers 10,000 tps of throughput, i.e. 1 billion transactions per day, while offering 1 second block times and 1 second finality.  This allows Monad to support many more users and far more interactive experiences than existing blockchains, while offering far cheaper per-transaction costs.
      What's familiar about Monad?
      From a user perspective, Monad behaves very similarly to Ethereum. You can use the same wallets (e.g. MetaMask) or block explorers (e.g. Etherscan) to sign or view transactions. The same apps built for Ethereum can be ported to Monad without code changes, so it is expected that you'll be able to use many of your favorite apps from Ethereum on Monad. The address space in Monad is the same as in Ethereum, so you can reuse your existing keys.
      Like Ethereum, Monad features linear blocks, and linear ordering of transactions within a block. 
      Like Ethereum, Monad is a proof-of-stake network maintained by a decentralized set of validators. Anyone can run a node to independently verify transaction execution, and significant care has been taken to keep hardware requirements minimal.
      What's different about Monad?
      Monad makes exceptional performance possible by introducing parallel execution and superscalar pipelining to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
      Parallel execution is the practice of utilizing multiple cores and threads to strategically execute work in parallel while still committing the results in the original order.  Although transactions are executed in parallel "under the hood", from the user and developer perspective they are executed serially; the result of a series of transactions is always the same as if the transactions had been executed one after another.
      Superscalar pipelining is the practice of creating stages of work and executing the stages in parallel. A simple diagram tells the story:
      A familiar example of pipelining: doing laundry intelligently. Top: naive; bottom: pipelined.  Credit: ​
      When doing four loads of laundry, the naive strategy is to wash, dry, fold, and store the first load of laundry before starting on the second one.  The pipelined strategy is to start washing load 2 when load 1 goes into the dryer.  Pipelining gets work done more efficiently by utilizing multiple resources simultaneously.
      Monad introduces pipelining to address existing bottlenecks in state storage, transaction processing, and distributed consensus.  In particular, Monad introduces pipelining and other optimizations in four major areas:
      (pipelined HotStuff consensus with additional research improvements)
      (pipelining between consensus and execution to significantly increase the execution budget)
      high-performance state backend)
      Monad's client, which was written from scratch in C++ and Rust, reflect these architectural improvements and result in a platform for decentralized apps that can truly scale to world adoption.
      Why should I care?
      Decentralized apps are replacements for centralized services with several significant advantages:
      Open APIs / composability: decentralized apps can be called atomically by other decentralized apps, allowing developers to build more complex functionality by stacking existing components.
      Transparency: app logic is expressed purely through code, so anyone can review the logic for side effects. State is transparent and auditable; proof of reserves in DeFi is the default.
      Censorship-resistance and credible neutrality: anyone can submit transactions or upload applications to a permissionless network.
      Global reach: anyone with access to the internet can access crucial financial services, including unbanked/underbanked users.
      However, decentralized apps need cheap, performant infrastructure to reach their intended level of impact. A single app with 1 million daily active users (DAUs) and 10 transactions per user per day would require 10 million transactions per day, or 100 tps. A quick glance at  - a useful website summarizing the throughput of existing EVM-compatible L1s and L2s - shows that no EVM blockchain supports even that level of throughput right now.
      Monad materially improves on the performance of an EVM-compatible blockchain network, pioneering several innovations that will hopefully become standard in Ethereum in the years to come.
      With Monad, developers, users, and researchers can reuse the wealth of existing applications, libraries, and applied cryptography research that have all been built for the EVM.
      How do I use Monad?
      Monad's first public testnet will go live in the coming months.
      When it does, you will be able to add an appropriate RPC url and ChainId to your Ethereum-compatible wallet and begin using Monad like you would any other Ethereum-compatible network. Until then, stay tuned!


      Monad for developers
Monad is an Ethereum-compatible Layer-1 blockchain with 10,000 tps of throughput, 1-second block times, and single-slot finality.
Monad's implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine complies with the ; simulation of historical Ethereum transactions with the Monad execution environment produces identical outcomes. Monad also offers full Ethereum RPC compatibility so that users can interact with Monad using familiar tools like MetaMask and Etherscan.
Monad accomplishes these performance improvements through the introduction of several major innovations:
​ (pipelined HotStuff consensus with additional research improvements), 
​ (pipelining between consensus and execution to significantly increase the execution budget)
​​
​ (high-performance state backend)
Although Monad features parallel execution and pipelining, it's important to note that blocks in Monad are linear, and transactions are linearly ordered within each block.

Consensus mechanism and pipelining
​ is a leader-based algorithm for reaching agreement about transaction order and inclusion under partially synchronous conditions. Broadly characterized, it is a derivative of HotStuff with additional research improvements.

MonadBFT is a pipelined 2-phase BFT algorithm with linear communication overhead in the common case. As in most BFT algorithms, communication proceeds in phases. At each phase, the leader sends a signed message to the voters, who send back signed responses.  Pipelining allows the quorum certificate (QC) or timeout certificate (TC) for block k to piggyback on the proposal for block k+1. Timeouts incur quadratic messaging.
Block time
1 second
Finality
Single-slot.  Once 2/3 of the stake weight has voted YES on a block proposal, it is finalized.
Mempool
There is a . Transactions are erasure-coded and communicated using a broadcast tree for efficiency.
Spam resistance
Users pay for inclusion in blocks ("") and transaction execution ("execution cost").
Consensus participants
Direct consensus participants vote on block proposals and serve as leaders. To serve as a direct participant, a node must have at least MinStake staked and be in the top MaxConsensusNodes participants by stake weight. These parameters are set in code.
Transaction hashing
For efficiency, block proposals refer to transactions .  If a node does not have a transaction, it will request the transaction by hash from a neighbor.
Deferred execution and carriage costs
In Monad, consensus and execution occur in a pipelined fashion.  Nodes come to consensus on the official transaction order prior to executing that ordering (); the outcome of execution is not a prerequisite to consensus.
​
In blockchains where execution is a prerequisite to consensus, the time budget for execution is a small fraction of the block time.  Pipelining consensus and execution allows Monad to expend the full block time on both consensus and execution.

Block proposals consist of an ordered list of transaction hashes and a state merkle root from D blocks ago.  The delay parameter D is set in code; it is expected that D = 10 initially.
​
The user must pay to have a transaction included in a block (the "").  For each address, nodes maintain two balances:
a reserve balance, used to pay for this carriage cost
the execution balance, used to pay for transaction execution
Carriage cost is charged to the reserve balance when the transaction is included in a block (consensus); it is deducted from the execution balance at execution time (double charge), and repaid to the reserve balance after the delay period of D blocks passes.
​
An account's reserve balance is effectively a budget for "in-flight" orders; it exists to ensure that only transactions that are paid for are included in blocks.
​
Each account has a target reserve balance which can be altered by interacting with an enshrined smart contract, e.g. for EOAs that anticipate sending a large number of inflight orders.
State determinism 
Finality occurs at consensus time; the official ordering of transactions is enshrined at this point, and the outcome is fully deterministic for any full node, who will generally execute the transactions for that new block in under 1 second.

The D-block delay for state merkle roots is only for state root verification, for example for allowing a node to ensure that it didn't make a computation error.
Execution
The execution phase for each block begins after consensus is reached on that block, allowing the node to proceed with consensus on subsequent blocks.
Parallel Execution
Transactions are linearly ordered; the job of execution is to arrive at the state that results from executing that list of transactions serially.  The naive approach is just to execute the transactions one after another.  Can we do better?  Yes we can!
Monad implements :
An executor is a virtual machine for executing transactions. Monad runs many executors in parallel.
An executor takes a transaction and produces a result. A result is a list of inputs to and outputs of the transactions, where inputs are (ContractAddress, Slot, Value) tuples that were SLOADed in the course of execution, and outputs are (ContractAddress, Slot, Value) tuples that were SSTOREd as a result of the transaction.
Results are initially produced in a pending state; they are then committed in the original order of the transactions. When a result is committed, its outputs update the current state. When it is a result’s turn to be committed, Monad checks that its inputs still match the current state; if they don’t, Monad reschedules the transaction. As a result of this concurrency control, Monad’s execution is guaranteed to produce the same result as if transactions were run serially.
When transactions are rescheduled, many or all of the required inputs are cached, so re-execution is generally relatively inexpensive. Note that upon re-execution, a transaction may produce a different set of Inputs than the previous execution did;
MonadDb: high-performance state backend
All active state is stored in , a storage backend for solid-state drives (SSDs) that is optimized for storing merkle trie data.  Updates are batched so that the merkle root can be updated efficiently.
MonadDb implements in-memory caching and uses  for efficient asynchronous reads and writes.  Nodes should have 32 GB of RAM for optimal performance.

Why Monad: decentralization + performance
Decentralization matters
A blockchain has several major components:
Consensus mechanism for achieving agreement on transactions to append to the ledger
Execution/storage system for maintaining the active state
In increasing the performance of these components, one could cut corners, for example by requiring all of the nodes to be physically close to each other (to save on the overhead of consensus), or by requiring a huge amount of RAM (to keep much or all of the state in memory), but it would be at a significant cost to decentralization.
And decentralization is the whole point!
As discussed in , decentralized shared global state allows many parties to coordinate while relying on a single, shared, objective source of truth. Decentralization is key to the matter; a blockchain maintained by a small group of node operators (or in the extreme case, a single operator!) would not offer benefits such as trustlessness, credible neutrality, and censorship-resistance.
For any blockchain network, decentralization should be the principal concern. Performance improvements should not come at the expense of decentralization.
Today's performance bottlenecks
Ethereum's current execution limits (1.25M gas per second) are set conservatively, but for several good reasons:
Inefficient storage access patterns
Single-threaded execution
Very limited execution budget, because consensus can't proceed without execution
Concerns about state growth, and the effect of state growth on future state access costs
Monad addresses these limitations through algorithmic improvements and architectural changes, pioneering several innovations that will hopefully become standard in Ethereum in the years to come.  Maintaining a high degree of decentralization, while making material performance improvements, is the key consideration.
Addressing these bottlenecks through optimization
Monad enables pipelining and other optimizations in four major areas to enable exceptional Ethereum Virtual Machine performance and materially advance the decentralization/scalability tradeoff. Subsequent pages describe these major areas of improvement:

Transaction lifecycle in Monad
Transaction submission
The lifecycle of a transaction starts with a user preparing a signed transaction and submitting it to an RPC node.
Transactions are typically prepared by an application frontend, then presented to the user's wallet for signing.  Most wallets make an eth_estimateGas RPC call to populate the gas limit for this transaction, although the user can also override this in their wallet.  The user is also typically asked to choose a gas price for the transaction, which is a number of NativeTokens per unit of gas.
After the user approves the signing in their wallet, the signed transaction is submitted to an RPC node using the eth_sendTransaction or eth_sendRawTransaction API call.
Of note, in Monad, the gas limit is the sum of the carriage gas and the execution gas.  Carriage gas is a constant.

Mempool propagation
The RPC node forwards the pending transaction to other Monad nodes that are participating in consensus.  The set of pending transactions is colloquially referred to as the 'mempool'.  See  for additional details on mempool behavior.  
For spam prevention reasons, nodes add the transaction to their mempool only if there is sufficient gas in the .

Block inclusion
MonadBFT uses a rotating leader mechanism to produce blocks. Each round, a leader assembles a block from the list of pending transactions. After choosing a transaction to be included in the block, the leader decrements the reserve balance with the carriage cost.
Blocks are propagated through the network as discussed in .  The quorum certificate (QC) for this block is propagated in the subsequent round of consensus (i.e. is sent out by the next leader).  After seeing the QC, voting nodes send each other votes; when a node sees 2/3 of the stake weight vote yes, it finalizes that block.
Once the block is finalized, the transaction has officially "occurred" in the history of the blockchain.  Since its order is determined, its truth value (i.e., whether it succeeds or fails, and what the outcome is immediately after that execution) is determined.
Local execution
As soon as a node finalizes a block, it begins executing the transactions from that block.  For efficiency reasons, transactions are executed , but it is as if the transactions were executed serially, since results are always committed in the original order.
Querying the outcome
The user can query the result of the transaction by calling eth_getTransactionByHash or eth_getTransactionReceipt on any RPC node. The RPC node will return as soon as execution completes locally on the node.    

Using Monad

1.Running a node
The following hardware requirements are expected to run a Monad full node:
CPU: 16 core CPU
Memory: 32 GB RAM
Storage: 2 TB NVMe SSD
Bandwidth: 100 Mb/s

2. Developing on Monad
Suggested Resources
Monad is fully EVM bytecode-compatible, with all supported opcodes and precompiles as of the . Monad also preserves the standard Ethereum JSON-RPC interfaces.
As such, most development resources for Ethereum Mainnet apply to development on Monad.
This page suggests a minimal set of resources for getting started with building a decentralized app for Ethereum. Child pages provide additional detail or options. 
As  is the most popular language for Ethereum smart contracts, the resources on this page focus on Solidity; alternatively see resources on  or . Note that since smart contracts are composable, contracts originally written in one language can still make calls to contracts in another language.

Advanced Solidity
The  and  provide gas-optimized contracts utilizing Solidity or Yul.
​ is a intermediate language for Solidity that can generally be thought of as inline assembly for the EVM. It is not quite pure assembly, providing control flow constructs and abstracting away the inner working of the stack while still exposing the raw memory backend to developers. Yul is targeted at developers needing exposure to the EVM's raw memory backend to build high performance gas optimized EVM code. 
​ is most closely described as EVM assembly. Unlike Yul, Huff does not provide control flow constructs or abstract away the inner working of the program stack. Only the most upmost performance sensitive applications take advantage of Huff, however it is a great educational tool to learn how the EVM interprets instructions its lowest level.
Local nodes
Developers often find it helpful to be able to run a 1-node Ethereum network with modified parameters to test interaction with the blockchain:
​ is a local Ethereum node packaged in the Foundry toolkit
​ is a local Ethereum node packaged in the Hardhat toolkit
Installation is most easily done as part of installing the respective toolkit, described in the next section.
Toolkits
Developers often find it helpful to build their project in the context of a broader framework that organizes external dependencies (i.e. package management), organizes unit and integration tests, defines a deployment procedure (against local nodes, testnet, and mainnet), records gas costs, etc.
Here are the two most popular toolkits for Solidity development:
​ is a Solidity framework for both development and testing. Foundry manages your dependencies, compiles your project, runs tests, deploys, and lets you interact with the chain from the command-line and via Solidity scripts. Foundry users typically write their smart contracts and tests in the Solidity language.
​ is a Solidity development framework paired with a JavaScript testing framework. It allows for similar functionality as Foundry, and was the dominant toolchain for EVM developers prior to Foundry.
Interacting with the Ethereum RPC API
Frontends for dapps typically use JavaScript or Python to submit read or write queries to an RPC node. This code is typically referred to as the "client side", as web developers can roughly equate the blockchain to a backend server.
A few libraries provide standard methods for submitting queries or transactions to an RPC node:
Python:
​​
Javascript:
​​
​ To this end  and , Java Script and Python libraries respectively, have developed to make interacting with blockchains more intuitive for web developers.
Here is a quick example for creating a frontend: .
Testnets
Monad Testnet will be available for developers in the coming months, however, being bytecode and RPC compatible with the EVM means developers wishing to deploy on Monad can preliminary use .
